# Contributing

## Before contributing

This library is a thin wrapper (the "react wrapper") around Mathlive (the "base library"). It's likely that errors encountered when using the wrapper originate in the base library. Likewise, feature-requests and feature-PRs should probably go directly into the base library as well. 

## What to contribute

Contributions to the react-wrapper can be issues, feature-requests or pull-requests (code), that should 

* improve the interaction of react and mathlive, 
* make sure best practices in react are used
* simplify using of the wrapper
* improve the general code style
* add test-cases
* adjust for new react / mathlive versions or
* fix existing bugs in the implementation.

This wrapper does not aim to add too much functionality or additional wrapping around the base library. This minimizes the necessary maintenance to keep the wrapper compatible with future versions.

## How to contribute

Feel free to create an issue if you have any problem that you think originates in this wrapper. If you want to contribute code, fork the repository on github and create a pull request for master.
